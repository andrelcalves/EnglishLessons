 My American vacation by Emily

Last year my brother and I went on a very 
adventurous(WRONG) vacation to the U.S. We spent three days hiking through the Grand Canyon, and there was an 
optional trip to go whitewater rafting if you wanted to. I’m not very 
attractive(WORNG), so I decided not to go, but my brother went. He said it was amazing! But I wasn’t too scared to walk on the glass Skywalk over the canyon, even though the glass looked 
breakable, and it’s a long way to fall!!

Next, we traveled to Yellowstone National Park by bus. At times the trip seemed 
endless (it’s fourteen hours), but I was glad we went. The scenery along the way is very 
impressive(WORNG), with beautiful mountains, lakes and trees. Yet I was surprised to see some 
homeless people living in the woods outside Salt Lake City. Of course, the most famous thing to see at Yellowstone is Old Faithful – a very 
powerful geyser, which sends boiling hot water up into the air every hour. It’s really 
memorable(WORNG)!

On our last day we met Jake, a park ranger. He’s very 
ambitious, so he wants to open a new extreme sports company in Yellowstone, and my brother’s going to help him.
