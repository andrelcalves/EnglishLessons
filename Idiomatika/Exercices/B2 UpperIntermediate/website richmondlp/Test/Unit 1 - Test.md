 Surprise Birthday Party

My last birthday party was planned by a close friend of mine. It took place at a friend's house, and I was not expecting to have any birthday party for myself in the next few years. My plan was to go on a trip with my wife. However, my friends always talked about my last birthday party that happened ten years ago and how I liked to go and help organize their parties, but they never wanted to organize one for me.

The party was a success. Everything was well organized, and my close friends were reunited. They did their best, and their wives bought a chocolate cake. There were plenty of special drinks, and even a band was hired to play for more than three hours.

I really don't want to have a birthday party again. I am not a fan of celebrating my day, and I prefer to be in a quiet place, having a reserved time. However, I must say that I loved the surprise, and I will be grateful to them for making it happen.
